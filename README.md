## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook performs sentiment analysis on a given dataset. It utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models to classify text as positive, negative, or neutral. The notebook includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

## Features
- Data loading and preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, etc.)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF or word embeddings
- Training sentiment classification models
- Model evaluation and performance metrics
- Sentiment prediction on new text inputs

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed before running the notebook:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn nltk tensorflow keras
```

## Usage
1. **Load the Dataset**: Ensure the dataset is available in the required format (CSV, JSON, etc.).
2. **Run the Preprocessing Steps**: Text cleaning, tokenization, and feature extraction.
3. **Train the Model**: Choose a machine learning or deep learning model for classification.
4. **Evaluate the Model**: Check performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. **Make Predictions**: Use the trained model to classify new text samples.

## Files Included
- `Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the sentiment analysis workflow.
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset (if applicable).
- `models/`: Directory to save trained models.

## Notes
- The notebook supports various ML models, including logistic regression, SVM, and deep learning (LSTMs, CNNs).
- Pretrained word embeddings like Word2Vec or GloVe can be used for better performance.
- Ensure dataset preprocessing aligns with the dataset structure.

## Contribution
Feel free to contribute by improving data preprocessing, adding more models, or optimizing the existing pipeline.
